# Project Overview
In this project, I developed an interactive business intelligence report using Power BI, leveraging data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain operating in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. \
The project involved end-to-end workflow management, including data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization. The final report provides actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, regional sales trends, and financial metrics.
